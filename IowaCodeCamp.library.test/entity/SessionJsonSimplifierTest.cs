So we create objects and functions that can be used to patch up these problematic areas.\\n\\nThis session will go into detail about the type of problems that should be handled with reusable code, how to write objects and functions that are extensible and configurable, and what is required to effectively share this code with other developers. Fundamentals of framework and API design will be discussed. Examples will be used from a number of languages showing the distinct ways they allow us to write reusable code. Base objects from SDKs like iOS and Android will be used examples of how others have approached code reusability and how we can extend these objects.\",\r\n            \"room\" : \"132E\",\r\n            \"speaker\" : {\r\n                \"web\" : \"http://bitmethod.com/\",\r\n                \"location\" : \"Des Moines, IA\",\r\n                \"name\" : \"Neil Roberts\",\r\n                \"bio\" : \"Neil is a Dojo master (unrelated to Kung-Fu) and an accomplished programmer, educator, and author.

Relational databases model relations between entities, but traversing these relations can be prohibitively slow due to table joins. In the NoSQL world, key/value and document stores are focused on storing unconnected, denormalized data and typically do not provide good support for relational data. Data in these domains ends up resembling a graph, where the nodes are entities connected together by different types of edges. In graph databases, also part of NoSQL, relations between objects are first-class citizens of the data store. This more closely fits the structure of the domain and speeds up the basic data access required to serve pages in modern web applications. It also opens the door to an advanced set of algorithms based on graph traversals, like search and recommendations.
